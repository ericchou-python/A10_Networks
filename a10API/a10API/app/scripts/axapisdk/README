The applications using python AXAPI sdk library has to set the path to
python_sdk parent directory, whereas the python application can reside
anywhere. But ideally it would reside outside of SDK directory if it is
an external program or under test if it is a tool.

The application can set the path appropriate as follows:

import sys
sys.path.append(sdk_path)

where sdk_path is the parent directory containing AXAPI SDK package.
